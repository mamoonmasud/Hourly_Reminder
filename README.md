This is something I worked on when I was starting out in Python and just wanted to see how scripts works.  <br/> 

What this script does? <br/>
It sends you a reminder after every 55 mins (Can be changed easily), to take a break, and then after 5 mins to get back to working!
This is super helpful when you are working on those coding projects that take up a lot time and when taking a 5 mins break can be super refreshing.  <br/>
This uses Python's <a href="https://plyer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#:~:text=Plyer%20is%20a%20Python%20library%20for,accessing%20features%20of%20your%20hardware%20%2F%20platforms." target="_new">Plyer Library</a>, which is used for accessing the hardware features of our PC. This works on Windows, I'm not sure what needs to changed to get it working in MAC.

### To Run:
In order to run this, you'd need to open command line, go to the directory where you have the .py file, and run _pythonw .\reminder.py_

P.S: I also made a cool logo for this, in photoshop. It's just my initials in Arabic/Persian Script. It can be changed easily in the code, with the only requirement being that you'd need the logo in .ico format!
